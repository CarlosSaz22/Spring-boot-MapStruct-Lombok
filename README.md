This repository showcases the implementation of efficient object mapping solutions in Java projects using MapStruct and Lombok within the Spring Boot 3.5.4 framework and Java 21.

The code demonstrates how to dramatically simplify and optimize the conversion between different object types, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.

Key achievements in this repo include:

Leveraging MapStruct to automate the mapping between various DTOs and entity classes with minimal manual coding.

Employing Lombok annotations such as @Getter, @Setter, @Builder, and @AllArgsConstructor to eliminate repetitive code.

Seamlessly integrating MapStruct and Lombok to create clean, efficient, and readable code.

Implementing object mapping workflows both with the support of Spring Boot as well as in standalone Java code without additional frameworks.

Adding automatic formatting and mapping for special field types like dates and currency.

Applying best practices for designing DTOs, especially for the domain/business layer of applications.

Utilizing Maven and Gradle as build tools to manage dependencies and build processes effectively.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern Java development techniques aimed at enhancing productivity, reducing verbosity, and creating maintainable and high-quality code in enterprise Java applications.
