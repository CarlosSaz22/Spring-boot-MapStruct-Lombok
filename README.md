Welcome to this highly efficient Java object mapping project, where modern development meets simplicity and power! This repository demonstrates how to revolutionize your Java applications by drastically reducing boilerplate code, automating tedious mapping tasks, and writing clean, maintainable, and performance-optimized code using two essential libraries: MapStruct and Lombok — all within the latest Spring Boot 3.5.4 and Java 21 ecosystem.

✨ What You’ll See Here
💡 Automatic Object Mapping: Effortlessly convert between complex DTOs and entities using MapStruct’s compile-time generated mappers.

🔥 Boilerplate-Free Code: Say goodbye to repetitive getters, setters, constructors, and builders with Lombok’s elegant annotations.

🔗 Seamless Integration: Experience the magic of combining MapStruct and Lombok to produce clean, concise, and highly readable code.

🌱 Flexible Usage: Mapping workflows that shine both inside Spring Boot and in plain Java without framework dependencies.

📅💰 Smart Field Formatting: Automatic handling and formatting of date and currency fields to simplify your business logic.

🛠️ Best Practices: Designed with scalable DTO patterns and domain-driven design in mind — ideal for enterprise-grade applications.

⚙️ Maven & Gradle Support: Flexible build and dependency management with popular tools.

🎯 Why This Matters
Mastering these tools will make your Java development faster, your code cleaner, and your applications more robust. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, this project serves as a hands-on guide to elevate your skills and streamline your workflow in real-world Java projects.
